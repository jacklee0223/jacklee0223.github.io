##Bugs

1. Card is still registering tiles_flipped, id_memory even after it has been flipped, resulting in player change after two consecutive clicks on the same tile <b>FIXED</b> 
2. Another card is clickable after second click <b>FIXED</b>
3. The last piece on the music list doesn't play <b>fixed..but lame solution</b>
